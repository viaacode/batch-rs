Help for any of the subcommands can be invoked as such: `$ ./batch-rs help <SUBCOMMAND>`. For instance:

```bash
$ ./batch-rs help start
```

Output:

```
batch-rs-start
Start a batch. This will send out a so called "watchfolder-message" for every pair in the batch. If
an - optional - local_id is provided, then only this item will be started

USAGE:
    batch-rs start [OPTIONS] <BATCH_ID>

ARGS:
    <BATCH_ID>    Batch ID (formerly "name"): eg, 'QAS-BD-OR-123abc-2022-01-01-00-00-00-000'
                  There should be one and only one batch found via its ID

OPTIONS:
    -a, --auto-proceed           Auto proceed: A flag, if enabled, will skip the prompt asking to
                                 continue. This means that the batch will start automatically
                                 without asking explicit input
    -h, --help                   Print help information
